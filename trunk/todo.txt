Demo
----
Combine objects together
Make blocks not fall when you view their color.
Weird walking behavior when on switch
Picking up an object who has a combined child, removes the child

Post-Demo
---------
Make collision detection better
Add more types to the Execute() method in EventAction
Add new properties to the parser
Make collision detection and things not only use rectangles but work on diagnols
