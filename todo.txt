----
1 when carrying an object to combine with, show things that locally you can interact with regardless of color
3 Tooltips for the tutorial
2 Make it convenient to add a sensor
3 Add onseparation for eventactions
3 Make invisible GameObject
2 Add OneTime sensing to GameObject

Did Sense:
                        //if (OneTime)
            //{
                /* Removes collision events with obj */
            //    Events.RemoveAll(ev => (ev.Type == EventType.Collision && ev.CollisionTarget.Equals(obj)));
            //}
            

2 Clean up JSON specification

3 Make PushButton have both the box and the pusher as 2 different objects.
    That way we can animate the pusher being pushed in, and player will actually sit properly on the button.

1 EventAction: PlaySound
4 Add pickup animations
6 Music
5 All color mode
7 Linear path
5 Should not be allowed to drop a block into solid ground when you are up against it
9 Combine after one time
3 Alpha value for every object in JSON?

FIX LINEAR PATH WHY DOES IT NOT START SAME POSITION, ALSO OFF BY ONE AT END.
Benchmarking
Player gets stuck inside white platform. completely pooched.
Water comes in from offscreen. should be in the right place already.
physics seems to change based on computer?
picking up a block makes you jump faster
when level 1 loads, the player and block fall a bit
platform on level one now cuts into his head.

Defer
-----   
Sometimes when your next to a block it doesnt register as a collision, so you have to held MOVE keys to be considered near the block
fade between colors at rate of color wheel spin
Zoom in and out ("that would be kewl")
